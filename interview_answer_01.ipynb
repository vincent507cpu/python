    "# Problem: Simple Number Finding\n",
    "You are playing a card game with your friends. This game in China named “扎金花”. In this game, the 2, 3, 5 are some simple powerful numbers. Because the combination of 2,3,5 is less than any other combinations but greater than the AAA, which is the king in this game. In today, you want to find if a number is a simple number, in which their factors only include 2, 3 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your task is to find out whether a given number is an amazing number.\n",
    "```\n",
    "E.g\n",
    "Input: 6\n",
    "Output: (2, 3) Explanation: 6 = 2 x 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: 8\n",
    "Output: (2, 2, 2) Explanation: 8 = 2 x 2 x 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: 14\n",
    "Output:None\n",
    "Explanation: 14 is not amazing since it includes another prime factor 7.\n",
    "```\n",
    "How to check your answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you test 1845281250, your program should give (2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5);\n",

    "    Algorithm: Because 2, 3, 5 is a prime number of each other, I can safely find how many 2, 3, 5 are the factors of a given number one after another. If there are only 2, 3, 5s as factors of this number, the final number should be 1. Just to be consistent with the given answer, I put factors in order of 2, 3, 5. If a number contains other factors, return None.\n",
